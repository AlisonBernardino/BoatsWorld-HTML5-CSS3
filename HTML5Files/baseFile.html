<h1>FrontEnd World v1.0

</h1>
<hr />
<p>
  "Let's learn how to code in HTML by typing everything we learn."
</p>
<p> This text is inside a "p" tag.

</p>
<h2> Using "h2" and "hr" tags

</h2>
<p> We use a "h2" tag to target a Header type 2 text (Mostly known as model 02 title)
</p>
<hr>
<p> "hr" tags are used to make a black line like the example line above this text (This text line was also typed inside
  a "p" tag)
</p>
<hr>
<h2> The "br" tag

</h2>
<p> A tag known as "Break line" tag and used to break a text in 02 (two) parts.
  <br>
  This part is being show after a "break" (or "br" tag) insertion inside the text.
</p>
<p> Observation: To see the tags working, all the tags should be typed between "<" and ">" symbols (Without double
    quotes) <br>
    Examples:
    <br>
    < br> (Without the blank spaces between the tag and the symbols)
      <br>
      < hr>
        <br>
        <p>
        </p>

        <h2> Adding special symbols

        </h2>
        <p> We can add special symbols to our text, bars, items or components inside the HTML file.

        </p>
        <p> Here are some examples:

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> &reg = We type the "&" symbol + "reg" word

          </li>
          <li> &copy = "&" + "copy"

          </li>
          <li> &#8482 = "&" + "#8482"

          </li>
          <li> &cent = "&" + "cent"

          </li>
          <li> &pound = "&" + "pound"

          </li>
          <li> &yen = "&" + "yen"

          </li>
          <li> &#916 = "&" + "#916"

          </li>
          <li> &#8364 = "&" + "#8364"

          </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Observation: To see the results, all codes should be typed without "double quotes".
        </p>
